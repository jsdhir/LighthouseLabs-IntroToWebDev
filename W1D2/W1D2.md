### Intro to HTML

Hey guys, today we were introduced to HTML!

HTML is on component of the **Front-End Ecosystem** and it works hand in hand with CSS and front-end JavaScript.

It's important to differentiate between all three front-end components.

**HTML** aka **H** yper **T** ext **M** arkup **L** anguage provides **structure** and **context** to our app/website.

**CSS** aka Cascading Styling Sheet provides the **style** **look** and **feel** to our app/website.

**JavaScript** provides **interactivity** to our app/website. JavaScript is unique because it can be used on both front and back end.

If we think of the front-end ecosystem as a house, our HTML is our foundation and blueprint to our structure. The CSS is the painting, the tiles, wallpaper etc. JavaScript is the electronics, turning on water, all the fancy extra stuff that you, as a person can interact with (assuming you don't talk to walls).

### HTML 101

**Websites are structured with rectangles** Everything is a rectangle. Even if the image or shape is a circle or triangle there is still an invisible rectangle around that element.

#### Anatomy of a Webpage

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML> <!-- Tells the browser the document type -->
<html><!-- This tag wraps around everything -->
  <head>
    <!-- Everything in this tag is hidden
    Usually your meta data, javascript, css goes here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Everything visible goes here
    where most of your content goes -->
  </body>
</html>
```

#### HTML Elements

``` HTML
<p>I'm a pagraph</p>
```

`<p>` is an example of an opening tag.
`I'm a paragraph` is example of content.
`</p>` is an example of a closing tag.

Together, these three components make an **HTML Element**.

There are also self-closing tag elements such as `<img/>` `<br/>`

You don't need to overwhelm yourself to learn all of the tag types at once.
[Here are a list of tags.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

#### Sample HTML Elements

##### Paragraph Tag

`<p>I'm a paragraph</p>`

For General Text

##### Heading Tags

Do not confuse with `<head>` tag.

# <h1>
## <h2>
### <h3>
#### <h4>
##### <h5>
###### <h6>

As you can see there is a hierarchy of importance and size!

##### List Tags

**Unordered List:**

``` HTML
<ul>
  <li> I'm a list item</li>
  <li> I'm another list item</li>
</ul>
```

* I'm a list item
* I'm another list item

**Ordered List:**

``` HTML
<ol>
  <li>I'm a list item</li>
  <li> I'm another list item</li>
</ol>
```

1. I'm a list item
2. I'm another list item

##### Nesting

Have you noticed the indents? When we wrap elements within other elements we indent the line to show that there is a hierarchy.

Looking at the HTML for our ordered/unordered lists. We can see that the actual `<li>` list items are indented within the opening `<ol>` and the closing `</ol>`.

This is important for readability and debugging.

##### Links and Anchor Tags

To bring/call in a resource like a CSS file to a HTML file we use a `<link>` tag.

Example:

``` HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```

To display a clickable link that takes you to another page we use an **anchor** tag `<a>`.

Example:

``` HTML
<a alt="a link to a page" href="www.google.com">Google</a>
```

[Google](www.google.com)


##### Attributes

Looking at our links and anchor tags you can see that it was more detail than our previous examples, these details are called attributes. (Although we didn't add them to previous elements in these notes, all elements can have additional attributes such as classes, ids, alts, etc).

Example, looking at our `<link>` tag example, it includes a `rel`, `type`, `href` these are attributes of our link tag.

``` HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```

`link` is the tag.
`rel` is an attribute, stands for relationship
`type` is an attribute, for link tags, it identifies the type of source we are bringing into our HTML
`href` is an attribute, stands for hyper reference, so the file/URL we are referring to.

Example: looking at our `<a>`, it includes an `alt` and `href` attributes.

``` HTML
<a alt="a link to a page" href="www.google.com">Google</a>
```

`a` is the tag, short for anchor.
`alt` stands for alternative text, in the case of a anchor, it basically provides more context to the user when they hover over your anchor.

Other attributes that can be added to a tag/element include class and id which can be used to help add style to an element or interactions/events with JavaScript. Which we will look at next week.

##### Forms

Forms are also pretty common, think of logins/sign-ups etc. To start a form we use the `<form>` tag and we wrap it around `<labels>` which are used to ... surprise... label our `<input>` fields.

``` html
<form>
  <label for="first-name">First Name</label>
  <input name="first-name" type="text" placeholder="Ex. Sarah">
  <button type="submit">Submit!</button>
</form>
```

Here, we can see more attribute types such as  `for`, `name`, `placeholder`, `type`.

There are several `input` `type`, one being 'text'. [Here's a list of input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

The `label`'s `for` attribute basically helps to identify which input the label belongs to. It corresponds with the `input`'s `name` attribute.

For `input`, we have a `placeholder` attribute, which specifies the text that appears within an input elements content area.

`button`'s also have `type`s which include: submit, reset, or none. The submit type helps to submit a form.

Forms are useful for submitting data to the backend.
